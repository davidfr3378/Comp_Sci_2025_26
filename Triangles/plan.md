#### Assignment:
Write a C# program that allows the user to calculate the area of a triangle using either:
1. Two sides and an included angle (Trigonometric method).
2. Three sides (Heron's formula).

#### Note:
1. degree of angles must be to converted to radians to use Sine function.


#### Implementation list:
1. Basic structure to ask user for input (ask for information on the triangle; later ask them for the propertiy of triangle)


#### Extension Ideas:
1. Add input validation to ensure sides form a valid triangle.
2. Allow the user to calculate multiple triangle areas in a loop.
3. Allow for different types of triangles
4. Allow for other properties of triangles
